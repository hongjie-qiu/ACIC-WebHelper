In a Neotropical floodplain lake of the Amazon region, the temporal structure of ichthyoplankton was investigated and the hypothesis that the density of fish eggs and larvae and the diversity of species vary between two areas with different levels of environmental changes occurred was tested. The sampling occurred monthly between September 2017 and August 2018. Six sampling stations were used, distributed in locations …","publication_info":{"summary":"LS OLIVEIRA, RA Cajado… - Anais da Academia …, 2022 - SciELO Brasil","authors":[{"name":"LS OLIVEIRA","link":"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FoL2yJEAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra","serpapi_scholar_link":"https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=FoL2yJEAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en","author_id":"FoL2yJEAAAAJ"},{"name":"RA Cajado","link":"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0OTVl5cAAAAJ&hl=en&num=20&oi=sra","serpapi_scholar_link":"https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=0OTVl5cAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en","author_id":"0OTVl5cAAAAJ"}]},"resources":[{"title":"scielo.br","file_format":"HTML","link":"https://www.scielo.br/j/aabc/a/GzFNcTMnvWXZpQT5CWYKVMh/abstract/?lang=en"}],"bibtex_link":"https://scholar.googleusercontent.com/scholar.bib?q=info:raqNzYQoVaIJ:scholar.google.com/&output=citation&scisdr=CgUbSyTAGAA:AAGBfm0AAAAAY5pYf3dQS3wy-a0CRHauouDS8Ot8OG-m&scisig=AAGBfm0AAAAAY5pYf-AS-8EjCKT7yoOW-UpyQQpZPha1&scisf=4&ct=citation&cd=-1&hl=en","BibTex":"@article{oliveira2022structure,\n  title={Structure of the ichthyoplankton community in a Neotropical floodplain lake affected by environmental degradation},\n  author={OLIVEIRA, LUCAS S and Cajado, Ruineris A and SANTOS, LUAN RB DOS and Zacardi, Diego M},\n  journal={Anais da Academia Brasileira de Ci{\\^e}ncias},\n  volume={94},\n  year={2022},\n  publisher={SciELO Brasil}\n}\n","status":"Pending"}]
